# VDI Artifact Integrator

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Tool Overview

The VDI Artifact Integrator is a specialized forensic collection and analysis tool designed for Pooled VDI environments . In such environments, user artifacts are frequently fragmented across various Virtual Machines (VMs). This tool addresses the challenge of identifying user-accessed VMs and aggregating these fragmented data points into a single, cohesive analysis view.

### 1.2. Key Features

- Multi-Image Analysis: Supports batch processing of forensic evidence files (optimized for `.E01` format).
- Artifact Extraction & Integration:
- Windows Prefetch: Consolidates execution history across different sessions and VMs.
- Edge History: Aggregates fragmented web browsing activities.
- VM-Specific User Identification: Maps technical identifiers ( SID , Mantra ID ) to actual Usernames for precise attribution.

## 2. System Design & Implementation Environment

### 2.1. System Design

- GUI-based Integrated Interface: Provides a user-friendly environment for complex forensic workflows.
- Asynchronous Processing: Employs `QThread` to ensure the UI remains responsive during intensive data extraction and analysis.
- Recursive Artifact Extraction: Features a robust recursive search logic to handle diverse partition layouts and nested file system structures.
- Cross-Artifact Identity Mapping: Correlates `SOFTWARE` registry hives with `Security.evtx` logs to establish a reliable link between SIDs, Mantra IDs, and users.

## 3.2. Key Module Descriptions

main_window.py: Manages the main user interface. It ensures that heavy operations (like image loading) are offloaded to background threads to maintain UI stability.

vhd_manager.py: The heart of the file system analysis. It leverages pytsk3 and libewf to analyze partition structures. It uses a recursive search algorithm with wildcard support to locate and extract artifacts regardless of their directory depth.

sid_mapper.py: Responsible for user attribution. It extracts Mantra IDs from Security.evtx and maps them to Usernames using the SOFTWARE registry hive.

edge_history_parser.py: Consolidates fragmented browser history databases into a single, unified timeline.

prefetch_parser.py: A wrapper that invokes PECmd.exe as a sub-process, ensuring industry-standard accuracy in prefetch analysis.

# 4. Usage

## 4.1. Prerequisites & Installation
Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed, then run:

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4.2. Analysis Workflow

1. Load Evidence: Import multiple .E01 files into the analysis list.
